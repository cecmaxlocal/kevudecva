Licenses related to coffee vary depending on context: whether it's about professionally licensing coffee quality, or legally licensing the business and sale of coffee products.

### Coffee Quality Licensing
- The Specialty Coffee Association offers professional licenses like the Q Grader Program, which certifies individuals in coffee cupping and sensory analysis. This is a recognized license in the coffee industry for quality assessment and expertise.[1]

### Business Licenses for Coffee Sellers and Shops
- To sell coffee, whether as a store, café, or online retailer, typical licenses include:
  - A general business license issued by local government to legally operate.
  - A seller’s permit or sales tax license for collecting and remitting sales tax on physical coffee products.
  - Food service or health department permits to ensure compliance with food safety regulations.
  - Other possible licenses may include a trademark user license (for selling under a brand), a coffee dealer's license (in some jurisdictions), or a coffee works license for processing beans.[2][3][4][5][6][7]

### Summary
If you want to open a coffee shop or sell coffee, you will at least need a business license and health permits. A license to sell coffee online also usually requires a seller’s permit to handle sales tax. For professional coffee quality evaluation, licenses like the Q Grader certify expertise in the industry.

If you specify the exact licensing context (professional certification, business, wholesale, or retail), more precise information can be provided.
