Mathematical software licenses vary depending on the type of software and the intended use, such as academic, commercial, or personal.

### Common License Types for Mathematical Software
- **Single-User License:** Grants one user the right to install and use the software on a specific machine. Common for personal or small-scale use. Example: Mathematica single-user license.[1]
- **Network License (Concurrent):** Allows multiple users to share a pool of licenses over a network, used in labs or institutions where many users access software intermittently.[1]
- **Perpetual License:** Allows indefinite use of a specific version of the software after a one-time purchase. Widely used in academic and professional settings for mathematical tools like MATLAB, SPSS, or Mathcad.[2][3][7]
- **Subscription License:** Provides access for a limited time, often with ongoing updates and support included. Common in modern licensing models for software like MATLAB.[3][2]
- **Academic and Research Licenses:** These licenses are discounted or modified terms for educational institutions, researchers, and students to facilitate learning and scientific work.[4][7]

### Licensing in Popular Mathematical Software
- **Mathematica:** Offers single user and network licenses; network licensing requires a license server.[1]
- **MATLAB:** License options include personal use, commercial, academic, startup, and student licenses with perpetual or subscription terms.[3]
- **Mathcad Prime:** Provides different licensing bases tailored to engineering and math professionals.[6]

### Summary
Mathematical software licenses are designed to suit varied environments from individual to institutional use, with flexible licensing models such as single-user, network concurrent, perpetual, and subscription licenses. Academic licenses are commonly available to support educational and research purposes. This ensures access, scalability, and compliance based on user needs and budgets.[2][4][6][3][1]
