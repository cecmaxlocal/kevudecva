Apple licenses its software primarily through non-transferable, limited, and non-exclusive licenses tied to Apple-branded hardware. 

### Key Types of Apple Software Licenses:
- **Single-copy license:** Apple grants a license to install and use one copy of the Apple software on a single Apple-branded computer at a time. This applies to software pre-installed on Apple hardware or obtained under volume or maintenance agreements.[1][4][5]
- **Mac App Store license:** Software downloaded via the Mac App Store is licensed for personal, non-commercial use on Apple-branded products owned or controlled by the user. These licenses are non-transferable and are subject to specific usage rules governed by Apple Media Services Terms.[6][1]
- **Developer and third-party app licenses:** Apple also grants licenses for third-party apps distributed on its platforms (e.g., App Store) under standard or custom End User License Agreements (EULAs). These licenses generally restrict usage to Apple devices owned by the licensee.[3][6]
- **Lease and transfer restrictions:** Licensing generally prohibits transferring software outside of the bundled Apple hardware. Leasing or subleasing licenses is tightly controlled and subject to strict conditions.[1]

### Summary
Apple’s software licenses emphasize use on Apple-branded devices, restrict software transfer, and define personal vs. commercial usage boundaries. These licenses cover macOS, iOS, and other Apple software, including software obtained via the Mac App Store or directly bundled with Apple products. Compliance with Apple’s Terms of Service and related usage rules is mandatory for all licensees.[5][3][6][1]

This licensing approach ensures Apple controls software distribution and usage tightly within its ecosystem.
