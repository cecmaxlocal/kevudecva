The "license CEC" typically refers to licensing or certification regulated by the California Energy Commission (CEC). The CEC has exclusive authority in California to license and certify energy-related facilities and equipment.

### Key Licensing Areas Under CEC
- The CEC issues licenses for thermal power plants of 50 megawatts or larger, handling applications through the Application for Certification (AFC) process. This license replaces most other state, regional, or local permits and covers engineering, environmental, health, and safety evaluations.[1][4]
- The CEC also certifies eligible renewable energy generation and energy storage projects under an Opt-In Certification program. This facilitates timely permit processing for qualifying clean energy projects.[6]
- For products, the CEC regulates energy efficiency standards such as for lighting products, requiring compliance with stringent testing and labeling standards to promote energy efficiency in California buildings.[5][8]
- The CEC plays a central role in California's energy planning, compliance monitoring, and regulation enforcement, serving as a lead agency for environmental quality assessments related to energy facilities.[4][7]

### Summary
"License CEC" refers to the California Energy Commission's authority to license power plants, certify renewable and energy storage projects, and regulate energy efficiency compliance for appliances and equipment sold in California. Entities must obtain CEC licenses or certifications to operate large power plants or market energy-related products in California, ensuring compliance with safety, environmental, and efficiency standards.[1][4][5][6]
